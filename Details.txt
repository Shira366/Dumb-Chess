Not much to say here.

This code is does not work properly on discovered checks and certain other small things.

Use it as you may or just to have a good laugh.

install pygame to run this please!

The main file is of course main.py that needs to be run.

Thats about it..

(PS: Test every button in the main menu ;) )
